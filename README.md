# Surfs Up 

## Project Overview 

This project was conducted to help determine the viability of opening a surf and ice cream shop by looking at  temperature trends. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Analysis 

### June 

For the month of June we looked at 1700 data points and were able to generate the following statistics from Oahu's weather stations for the month of June, while image 2 shows the historical precipitation for June.

4. December Precipitation

### The following trends in temperature and precipitation have been obswerved for the months of June and December:
### Temperature Trends: 

* June's average temperature is 3.9 degrees farenheit higher than December
* June is warmer than December
* December's lowest temperature is 8 degrees lower than June's lowest
* Temperatures fluctuate more widely in December therefore making ice cream-consuming weather less predictible.

### Precipitation Trends 

* 75% of the days in June receive less than 0.12 inches of rain and 75% of the days in December receive 0.15 inches of rain
* Most days on Oahu have little to no rain
* The average rainfall in December is 0.08 inches higher than June
* while still minimal rainfall day-to-day, December gets 62% more rainfall on average
* Both December and June have days where a significant amount of rain falls, but they are rare.

## Conclusion

Based on the high temperatures year round and the lack of daily rainfall, the analysis shows that a business such as a surf/ice cream shop would do well in Oahu.
